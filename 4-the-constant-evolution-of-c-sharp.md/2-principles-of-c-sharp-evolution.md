- First, changes in C# tend to be incremental or evolutionary, rather than drastic. As new features are introduced, developers are given the flexibility to choose whether and when to adopt them. This means that new language features are typically non-breaking and minimally disruptive.
- Moreover, many of these changes come from the current best practices and idioms adopted by the broader C# developer community, which are later incorporated as first-class language features in future versions. Finally, when you do decide to adopt new features, they usually lead to code that is simpler, faster, saferâ€”or often, all of these things.
