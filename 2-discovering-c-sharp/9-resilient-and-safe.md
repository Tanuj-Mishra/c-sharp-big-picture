In case if we try to read element of array, with index out of range of it, then it will throw error

```
	a = [1,2,3];
	b = a[10];
```
	- in c++, it will throw some garbage value, but java will throw an error.
	- Thankfully, C# follows java in this, so it prevents system from doing some random behaviour.
